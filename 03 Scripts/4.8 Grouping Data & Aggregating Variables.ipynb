For instance, if the max order is 10, then that 10 will appear within the dataframe 10 times—once for each time that user ID made an order.\n",

You can check these values by scrolling through the “user_ID” column and matching the max order value to the number of times the user ID appears within the dataframe. For the user with an ID of 1, for instance, you can see that the numbers in the “order_number” column increase up to 10. This matches the value in the “max_order” column, so you know your data is accurate.\n",
